<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Qilin is a Java SDK for rapid prototyping of cryptographic protocols.
The purpose of the Qilin project is to make it easier to implement 
the new cryptographic protocol you just read (or wrote) about in a recent theory paper.
To this end, the API attempts to use the concepts and language from the theory of cryptography.</p>

<p>Qilin is not intended for writing the most <i>efficient</i> implementation of a cryptographic
protocol, or even the most <i>secure</i> implementation (although it does attempt to provide
reasonable efficiency and security). Instead Qilin is optimized for <i>rapid development</i> 
and <i>generality</i>.
 
 
<h2>Get Qilin</h2>
<p>Qilin is an open-source project (released under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT/X11 license</a>). We use the <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/">Mercurial</a> version-control system for development. If you have Mercurial installed, you can clone the repository using the command:</p>
<pre>
hg clone http://qilin.seas.harvard.edu/repo qilin-sdk
</pre>
<p>You can also browse the repository and download the entire source as a tarball or zip file using
the <a href="repo/">web interface</a>.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The SDK is <a href="docs/">documented with Javadoc</a>. 
Some more background on the project can be found in the <a href="docs/qilin/package-summary.html">qilin package summary</a>.
Qilin grew out of an implementation of the Phish-Market protocol; this implementation is distributed with 
the SDK and serves as example code. The <a href="docs/phishmarket/package-summary.html">phishmarket package summary</a> contains
an overview.</p>

<h2>Developing Qilin</h2>
<p>If you're looking for an interesting programming project and/or want to contribute your time to a worthy cause,
there are plenty of things you can do to help Qilin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add more primitives and protocols. Some possible suggestions are
  <ul>
  	<li>Other encryption protocols (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damgaard-Jurik_cryptosystem">Damg√•rd-Jurik</a>)</li>
  	<li>Primitives for cryptographic voting (e.g., verifiable shuffles).</li>
  </ul></li>
<li>Make Qilin more language-independent. Although Qilin is written in Java, one of the design
   goals is to make it easy to write compatible applications on other platforms. Most
   of the communication protocols are language-independent but some still make use of Java-specific properties (in particular, the automatic 
   FiatShamir heuristic can depends on how Java uses the Random class for various tasks.</li>
<li>Review/comment on existing code and SDK design.</li>
<li>Add documentation to existing code.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Submitting Patches</h3>
<p>Since Mercurial is a distributed version-control system, you can develop new features on private repository clones
and merge with the main repository once they're done. If you would like to submit a patch, a comment or to participate some other way,
please let me know. You can find my contact details on <a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu/~talm">my homepage</a>.

<h3>Qilin?</h3>
<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qilin">Qilin</a> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptid">Cryptid</a> from Chinese 
mythology. The preferred pronunciation for the project name is "Chillin" (as in "Get Chillin'"). </p>
