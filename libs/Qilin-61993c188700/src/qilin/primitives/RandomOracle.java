 * in theoretical constructions, and consequently is used in many protocols. 
 * In most cases, we do not know how to break protocols that replace the Random Oracle
 * with a secure cryptographic hash function (assuming the protocol is secure in the Random Oracle model).

 * This interface Random Oracle is easy to use when both the position at which the random oracle is queried
 * and the required output length are known in advance.
