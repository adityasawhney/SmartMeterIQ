This directory contains a TerminalFactory for javax.smartcardio
package that is able to connect and talk to the jcop emulator.
This emulator and the jcop library was once freely available but
has disappeared for some time. The jcop emulator has some
features that the emulators from SUN lack (most notably crypto).
Therefore, for those who still hava a copy of it, it is often the
better choice.

To use this package, you need to do the following steps:

1. add the DS_provider in this directory to your system

	DS_provider p = new DS_provider();
	Security.addProvider(p);

   This works for me. Apparently there is no security manager
   that interferes.

   A less preferred alternative is to statically configure the
   DS_provider. Search for a file java.security on your system
   that lists all preconfiged providers (on Debian etch it is
   /etc/java-6-sun/security/java.security). Then add there the line

      security.provider.9=ds.javacard.emulator.jcop.DS_provider

   where it might be necessary to replace the ``9'' with a
   different number.


2. Create your TerminalFactory as follows:

	TerminalFactory factory = 
	    TerminalFactory.getInstance("JcopEmulator", null);

   This will make a connection to an jcop instance running on the
   standard port 8015.


3. Add offcard.jar to your classpath.


4. Don't forget to start your emulator.
