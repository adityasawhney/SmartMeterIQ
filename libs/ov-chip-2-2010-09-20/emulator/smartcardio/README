This directory contains a TerminalFactory for javax.smartcardio 
package that is able to connect and talk to the jref and jcwde 
emulators. 

To use it, you need to do the following steps:

1. add the DS_provider in this directory to your system

	DS_provider p = new DS_provider();
	Security.addProvider(p);

   This works for me. Apparently there is no security manager
   that interferes.

   A less preferred alternative is to statically configure the
   DS_provider. Search for a file java.security on your system
   that lists all preconfiged providers (on Debian etch it is
   /etc/java-6-sun/security/java.security). Then add there the line

      security.provider.9=ds.ov2.emulator.DS_provider

   where it might be necessary to replace the ``9'' with a
   different number.


2. Create your TerminalFactory as follows:

	TerminalFactory factory = 
	    TerminalFactory.getInstance("SunEmulator", port_array);

   The port_array can be null, then one connection is build to
   the standard port 9025. It can also be an int array to connect
   to a non-standart port or to several ports.


3. Don't forget to start your emulators. (See also
   ../wrapper/owrapper for using one emulator instance with
   several host drivers.)
