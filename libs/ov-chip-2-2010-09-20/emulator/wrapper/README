This directory contains a wrapper for the jref/jcwde emulators that
makes it possible to connect with several host drivers one after each 
other to the same emulator instance. 

(Normally, when you close the connection to jref/jcwde it terminates.)

Originally I tried to write this in java, but gave up after two days. 
The problem is that 
- stdout/stderr are not inherited from child processes
- a blocking i/o operation on a stream cannot be interrupted
- there is no way to convert the ordinary Streams of a Process 
  instance into Selectable/Interruptable channels.

My attempt is still in Wrapper.java, it almost works. But only almost.
