/** 
 * Runtime representation of a protocol of the OV-chip protocol layer.
 * One protocol consists of a fixed list of steps (of type {@link
 * Protocol_step}) that must be executed in the given order. 
 * Besides the protocol steps every protocol instance must contain its
 * protocol identification number. This identification number must be
 * identical to the index at which this instance is stored in the
 * protocol array. Normally this is initialized in the right way by
 * {@link Registered_protocols#set_protocols
 * Registered_protocols.set_protocols}.
 * <P>
 *
 * Under normal circumstances the protocol instances are created and
 * referenced in the *_description classes, which are generated by the
 * IDL compiler. These classes are shared between the card and the
 * host driver. It is important that the protocol instances on the
 * host and the card are identical, otherwise the protocol layer will
 * not work.
