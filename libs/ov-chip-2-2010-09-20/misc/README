OV-chip 2.0 Project   Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen

This directory contains various one-shot programs and a few very
simple applets.

Contents
===========================================================================

Test Applets in subdirectories

- test_rsa		use the RSA_NOPAD cipher to compute 5^5

- test_jc222		invoke 
			javacardx.framework.math.BigNumber.getMaxBytesSupported
			to see if the applet runs on a 2.2.2
			platform. Works in the sun emulators,
			fails on all cards that I have.

- test_sha		Try SHA hashes on the card, in 2.2.1 the
                        hases are 20 bytes long and if the output
			array is not long enough a
                        ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception is
                        produced.

- test_int		Test int type.



Standalone programs:

- Host			generic host application for the test
			applets, started with the ``host'' script

- SHA_host		Invoke the SHA applet and check the
                        generated hash. Started via the sha_host script.

- identify		send identify apdu to a card and print the result

- iotest		test javax.smartcardio package of java 1.6

- ResponseAPDUTest	test ResponseAPDU printing 
			(which is very unsatisfactory)

- security		compute various security parameters
                        according to "Key Length" by Arjen K.
                        Lenstra

- Test			experiments with the java crypto api

- ECTest		experiments with BouncyCastle EC crypto

- T			test some java features



Build instructions
===========================================================================

Follow these instructions to build the test applets, the generic
Host driver and the identify program. The other programs can
simply be compiled with javac.


1. first build the Applet_id tool

   make -C ../tools Applet_id.class

2. build the emulatorio libraries (only needed for Host.java, not
   for the applets)

   make -C ../emulator/smartcardio emulatorio.jar
   make -C ../emulator/jcop jcopio.jar

2. edit the config section of the Makefile there (or copy the
   config section into LocalMakefile, make your changes there)

3. compile the applets and the Host application

   make
