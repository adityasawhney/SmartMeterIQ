BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
============================================================================

Some optional features can be configured and prepared in step 3.
They require additional software to be installed. None of these
features is necessary for just talking to a java card.


1. Download and install the java card development kits version
   2.2.1 and unzip it (unzip java_card_kit-2_2_1-linux-dom.zip).

2. Configure the base path of the development kit in Makefile in
   variable JCKIT221.
   (Optionally copy to config section into the new file LocalMakefile and
    configure there).

3. [Optional, can safely be skipped]

   Configure and prepare any of the optional features, described below.

4. build everything

   make

   The applet will be in
   _java_build_dir/card/test/ov_test/javacard/ov_test.cap
   The host application will be in
   _java_build_dir/test_host/ds/ov2/*/*, to be started via
   ./test_host.




ADDING OPTIONAL FEATURES
=======================================================================

support for the jcop emulator
=======================================
   To enable support for connecting to the jcop emulator
   do the following:

     1. Find offcard.jar, coming from the jcop libraries, on your system.

     2. Configure its location in Makefile or LocalMakefile.

     3. make jcopio-jar


support for SUN emulators (cref, jcwde)
=======================================
   Note: Both SUN emulators have various limitiations that makes
   it impossible to run all the tests on these emulators. On cref
   applet installation fails because of insufficient memory. On
   jcwde the RSA cipher is not available.

   To enable support for connecting to one of the SUN emulators
   do the following:

     1. Download and install the java card sdk version 2.2.2.
        Replace JDKDIR with the directory where you install(ed) this.

        cd JDKDIR

	unzip java_card_kit-2_2_2-linux.zip
	cd java_card_kit-2_2_2
	unzip java_card_kit-2_2_2-rr-ant-tasks.zip 
	unzip java_card_kit-2_2_2-rr-bin-docs-do.zip 
	unzip java_card_kit-2_2_2-rr-bin-linux-do.zip 
	unzip java_card_kit-2_2_2-rr-specs.zip 

	cd back-to-this-directory

     2. Configure the location of the sdk version 2.2.2 in
        Makefile or LocalMakefile in the variable JCKIT222.

     3. make emulatorio-jar



Emacs error messages from the converter
=======================================
   [Obviously only needed for development.]

      1. Install ocamlopt.opt.

      2. make -C ../tools converter_errors


   If not present converter_errors.sh uses cat, otherwise the
   error messages of the converter are changed into a form that
   emacs can parse.
