  * Implemented new table parser with increased robustness.
    Now, subsequent tables without any text in-between cause
    no troubles anymore. The new table parser also allows for
    using multi-line table headers.

  * Fixed bug with references in table captions.

  * Added table attribute 'wide' that can be specified after
    the table label. This attribute is only interpreted by the
    Latex backend of GOSH and causes the usage of a 'table*'
    environment instead of a plain 'table' environment.
